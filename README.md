# Dev Padawan - Part 2

In this exercise we'll run a python script.

Switch to your command line tool and run the following command from within the folder where you have cloned this repository into:

```
python padawan_part2.py
```

As a result you should see the following message

```
HELLO PADAWAN!
```

If you get an error message you have some homework to do (unless you are simply not in the folder where the python file padawan_part2.py is).

## Homework

Install python on your computer and try the above command again until you see the message

```
HELLO PADAWAN!
```
